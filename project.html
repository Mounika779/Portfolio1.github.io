                        This application is developed using PHP, HTML, and MYSQL programming languages.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>The main objective of this project is building an application which will help the farmers to sell

                    <dd>BMI stands for Body Mass Index,which is physical measurement used to assess an individual's total amount of body fat.
                        It is a software application which avoids more manual hours that need to spend in personally calculate and find the BMI for a particular person 
                        in a single click.
                        The BMI scores given an indirect measurement of body fat depending on the BMI value calculated individually may be Underweight,Normalweight,overweight.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>The main objective of this project is to creat a full-fledged Android application which could increase the awareness of Overweight and Underweight.           
                    </dd>
            
                    <dt><li><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">AUTOMATION OF HR INTERVIEW USING DEEP LEARNING AND NLP</h3></li></dt>
